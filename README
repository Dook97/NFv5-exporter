# p2nprobe

Export information about TCP streams from a pcap file as
NetFlow v5 data.

## Building

Build requires a c++23 compiler and libpcap. Only usable in
POSIX environments.

## A warning

This was an exercise for me to learn about libpcap in which
creating a workable NFv5 exporter was a non-goal.

## Usage

```
USAGE

    p2nprobe <host>:<port> <pcap_file> [-a <active_timeout> -i <inactive_timeout>]
    p2nprobe -h

OPTIONS

    <host>:<port>  Socket address of a running NetFlow v5 collector

    <pcap_file>    The pcap file to be processed

    -a UINT        Duration since start of a flow after which it
                   is flushed. (optional; default 60s)

    -i UINT        Duration after which if no packet is sent a
                   flow is flushed (optional; default 60s)

    -h             This help
```
